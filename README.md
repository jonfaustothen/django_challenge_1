# Hello World App Using Django Framework
In this project, I create a website (on a local server) in which the user can enter their name after "hello/" to appear as text on the page.  I create an app with the django framework that receives any name from the user.  Django is a Python web framework which makes creating websites simple as it solves a lof of the web development.
